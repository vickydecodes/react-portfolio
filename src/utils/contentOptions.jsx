      "A story of how an idea turned into Cookie and the lessons I learned along the way.",
    slug: "how-i-started-my-startup-journey",
    fullContent: `Every startup begins with a story. For me, it started with a simple problem and a relentless desire to build something meaningful.

I didn’t have fancy investors or a massive team. Just passion, late nights, and the belief that technology could solve everyday problems.

From sketching ideas on napkins to pitching to friends, every step was a lesson in patience and perseverance.

Cookie wasn’t just a project—it was my journey of growth, failure, learning, and ultimately, progress.

If you’re starting your own path, remember: the journey is as important as the destination. Keep pushing, keep learning.`,

    slug: "fail-fast-learn-faster",
    fullContent: `Fail fast. It sounds cliché, but it’s a mindset that saved Cookie.

Early on, we made decisions that didn’t work. Features that customers ignored. Strategies that fell flat.

Instead of fearing failure, we welcomed it as feedback.

Each failure sharpened our focus and helped us pivot quickly.

Remember, failure isn’t defeat—it’s an opportunity to learn, adapt, and come back stronger.

Fail fast, yes. But more importantly, learn faster.`,

    slug: "balancing-vision-and-execution",
    fullContent: `Vision and execution — they’re the two sides of the same coin.

Vision without execution is just a dream. Execution without vision is just busywork.

At Cookie, we keep our vision clear: to build tech that truly helps businesses grow.

But that vision only matters if we execute daily — through small, deliberate actions.

I’ve learned to balance dreaming big with doing the work.

If you want to lead, don’t just envision the future — build it step by step.`,

      "It’s not about working 20 hours. It’s about making 4 hours count like 20. My thoughts on smart work culture.",
    slug: "why-smart-work-beats-hard-work",
    fullContent: `Working 20 hours a day sounds great — until it burns you out.

I’ve learned that smart work isn’t about laziness, it’s about leverage.

Instead of doing everything myself, I focus on systems. Delegation. Automation.

That’s how 4 hours of focused work can beat 20 hours of scattered effort.

At Cookie, we choose to optimize, not just hustle.

So here’s a rule I live by now: Think twice before working twice. Hustle hard, but think smarter.`,

      "Every 'yes' comes at a cost. Here's how saying 'no' more often gave me clarity and control.",
    slug: "the-power-of-saying-no",
    fullContent: `“No” is underrated.

Every time I say no to distractions, side projects, or low-value tasks — I’m saying yes to Cookie’s growth.

It’s hard. Especially in early stages when every offer feels like an opportunity.

But not every opportunity aligns with our mission.

Saying no helped me protect my time, my team’s energy, and our identity.

Learning to say no isn’t arrogance — it’s clarity.

And that clarity builds momentum.`,
